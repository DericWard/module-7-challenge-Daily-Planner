## module-7-challenge-Daily-Planner-app
### Description:
#### A JS/JQuery daily planner app that allows the user to add/edit/delete entries manually on a per-hour basis for a typical 9-5 working day.
#### This app uses MOMENT.JS to display a real-time clock on the main app screen.
#### A 'Save' button is available on each hourly slot for the user to save the data they have typed to Local Storage.
#### The 'Save' button's text changes to 'Saving...' for approximately 1500mS once clicked. 
#### Saved data persists in local storage even after the user leaves the page, or reboots their device.
#### Tasks remain until the user decides to erase them, assuming they have been either completed or are no longer relevant.
### Motivation:
#### To satisfy assignment 7 of edX's Front End Web Development bootcamp course to gain further practical experience
#### using JQuery, Moment.JS, and using Local Storage.
